                    January 2023<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




                    Considering The month of October year 2022.<br>
                    This was my best year and month of all time that due.<br>
                    Someone entered my war zone.<br>
                    Cringe to say, she cuts my feel of alone.<br><br>
                    
                    Flashbacked... Socializing is not my niche.<br>
                    But I do conversation when someone reached.<br>
                    I'm not a conversation starter, can't disagree with it.<br>
                    Introvert code isn't it ?<br><br>
                    
                    So then she came, out of nowhere.<br>
                    I found a home somewhere.<br>
                    And it turns out, she became my comfort zone.<br>
                    Out of the ghost town of my own.<br><br>
                    
                    I remember her smile, it's like living in prosperity.<br>
                    It's her brand and identity.<br>
                    her kissable lips, plus his chubby cheeks.<br>
                    When i see those, eventually I get weak in the knees.<br><br>
                    
                    The moment I met her, I would say, I already liked her.<br>
                    After those red velvet-taste of numerous night talks.<br>
                    She said, She's  already attached to me, folks..<br>
                    I slightly blushed, but I remembered: I'm the man in here.<br><br>
                    
                    At that moment, I felt the art of love.<br>
                    It's kinda unique, the feelings I have.<br>
                    My body releases heat out of excitement.<br>
                    Kinda unpredictable. What a turn of event!.<br><br>
                    
                    Days later, I always feel motivated. <br>
                    My alter ego has been triggered.<br>
                    Little she don't know, she's the reason.<br>
                    It's like a taste of four seasons.<br><br>
                    
                    She gave me a taste of happiness.<br>
                    She's my comfort, those emotions that i can express.<br>
                    With her, it's like I'm releasing a lot of dopamine.<br>
                    And I'm craving for more by no mean/s.<br><br>
                    
                    Not gonna lie, I'm looking forward to this.<br>
                    I really think and hope, she's the one.<br>
                    One time commitment, what my heart says.<br>
                    And I don't want my feelings to be gone.<br><br>
                    
                    Another turn of events<br>
                    That might have caused the mutual ends.<br>
                    This is what I fear most. <br>
                    And it keeps me feeling lost. <br><br>
                    
                    He encountered a man.<br>
                    I have a suspiciouns with him<br>
                    We sometimes talk about him.<br>
                    The feeling of jealousy always kicks in.<br><br>
                    
                    I overthink a lot.<br>
                    There are lots of "what if" scenarios.<br>
                    I have a rare feeling, which I should not.<br>
                    I thought we were serious.<br><br>
                    
                    Then the night went cold.<br>
                    as the other man went closer to her.<br>
                    I think I am the only one who keeps on hold.<br>
                    To those promising promises with her.<br><br>
                    
                    And the moment of truth speaks out.<br>
                    Then the butterflies in our stomachs came out.<br>
                    She says sorry and is confused in that sense.<br>
                    as she fell into the other man's presence. <br><br>
                    
                    I eventually downed by myself as the moment goes on.<br>
                    I don't want to be an option.<br>
                    But turns out, he already chose someone.<br>
                    I choose to say goodbyes to whom i considering the one. <br><br>
                    
                    I truly don't know what my brain wants to decode externally.<br>
                    But my mouth keeps on saying things out of sulking and pain.<br>
                    I really and always L_ _ _ her unconditionally<br>
                    Given that, I'm in vain.<br><br>
                    
                    It takes time to heal.<br>
                    And the hurt in feelings that I can't conceal<br>
                    Is this supposedly the right thing to feel?<br>
                    Or I just want this so badly, that it makes me ill...<br><br>
                    
                    Days already sound strange to me along the way.<br>
                    I wish I could walk by the bay.<br>
                    Walk alone, having time for myself.<br>
                    Instead of lying down in front of our shelf.<br><br>
                    
                    For the past months and days. <br>
                    I really felt, quite full of excitement. <br>
                    But as it turns out, destiny tricked me in disguise.<br>
                    Knowing that there's a change within the environment.<br><br>
                    
                    Sometimes, Tadhana is quite deceiving. <br>
                    It fools you into a trap, in shape of loving.<br>
                    Going back from being alone.<br>
                    Well I guess, I came back home.<br><br><br><br><br>
